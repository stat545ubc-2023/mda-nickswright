## What is this repository?
This repository was made for a mini-data analysis project in UBC course STAT 545 during the fall of 2023. It contains files from two different milestones, the first focused on data exploration and the second on data analysis. 

## Instructions
To look through this code please refer to the .md files directly. To actually run this code, clone the repository to your local computer and then run .rmd file in R and commit and push changes to git repository. 

### Milestone 1
The mini-project-1.md file contains my process of looking through several datasets to see what information they hold. I then selected the flow dataset to work with for this project and explored it using data visualization and filtering to look at patterns and connections. Finally, I drafted four questions about the flow data that I would like to answer statistically to understand processes of environmental change. 

### Milestone 2
The mini-project-2.md file contains my process of attempting to answer my 4 research questions through data cleaning and graphing for visual analysis. I then narrowed down by interests to 2 research questions and tidy'd the data needed for those questions. Next, I ran an ANOVA model to answer one of my research questions and then used the broom package to look at my results. Finally, I used the here:here function to save my data.
