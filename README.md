## What is this repository?
This repository was made for a mini-data analysis project in UBC course STAT 545 during the fall of 2023. It contains files from two different milestones, the first focused on data exploration and the second on data analysis. 

The mini-project-1.md file contains my process of looking through several datasets to see what information they hold, selecting the flow dataset to work with for this project, exploring it using data visualization and filtering to look at patterns and connections, and then drafting four questions about it that I would like to answer statistically.
